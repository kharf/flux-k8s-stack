# flux-k8s-stack
A catalog of Kubernetes tools for your Flux2 GitOps setup

---
## Getting started
Set up a [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/) source, which you can use for your Kustomizations to apply the manifests found in the catalog:

```yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
kind: GitRepository
metadata:
  name: flux-k8s-stack
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 5m0s
  url: https://github.com/kharf/flux-k8s-stack
  ref:
    branch: main # TODO: SemVer
```
You're ready to browse the [catalog](#catalog).
