  - CKV_K8S_43 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_39 - Ensure images are selected using a digest
  - CKV_K8S_14 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_13 - Ensure image tag is set to Fixed - not Latest or Blank (we use fixed tags, false positive because of base manifests)
  - CKV_K8S_15 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_14 - Ensure image pull policy is set to Always (most are set to IfNotPresent)
  - CKV_K8S_9 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_8 - Ensure readiness probe is configured (fast starting apps dont need that)
  - CKV_K8S_8 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_7 - Ensure liveness probe is configured
  - CKV_K8S_40 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_37 - Ensure containers run with a high UID to avoid host conflict (configured in container file)
  - CKV_K8S_31 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_29 - Ensure seccomp is set to Docker/Default or Runtime/Default (false positive on CronJob)
  - CKV_K8S_38 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_35 - Ensure service account tokens are mounted where necessary (needed for linkerd)
  - CKV_K8S_25 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_24 - Ensure admission of containers with added capability is minimized (needed for linkerd)
  - CKV_K8S_28 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_27 - Ensure admission of containers with NET_RAW capability is minimized (needed for emissary I think)
  - CKV_K8S_37 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_34 - Ensure admission of containers with capabilities assigned is limited (needed for emissary I think)
  - CKV_K8S_21 # Default namespace is used
  - CKV2_K8S_6 # Minimize the admission of pods which lack an associated NetworkPolicy (should be handled by customers of this catalog)
  - CKV_K8S_11 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/bc_k8s_10 - Ensure CPU limits are set (According to best practices you shouldn't set cpu limits)
  - CKV_GHA_7 # https://docs.bridgecrew.io/docs/the-build-output-cannot-be-affected-by-user-parameters-other-than-the-build-entry-point-and-the-top-level-source-location-github-actions-workflow_dispatch-inputs-must-be-empty - Ensure GitHub Actions does not contain workflow_dispatch inputs parameters
